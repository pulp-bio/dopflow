# DOPFLOW: 
## Open-Source Fully-Programmable Flow Phantom for Doppler Ultrasound
# Introduction

This repository contains the design files to reproduce the DOPFLOW system presented at IUS Joint Symposium 2024 [1].

DOPFLOW is an all-in-one Doppler Flow Phantom system that mimics the common carotid artery.
The platform has a modular design using off-the-shelf parts, including
- Custom syringe-based hydraulic pump, 
- Control printed circuit board, 
- Phantom body with both walled and wall-less channels,
- Graphical User Interface. 

The platform allows users to define pulsatile patterns, achieves maximum flow speeds over 1 meter per second and was validated with a commercial ultrasound Doppler machine (SONIX RP). These capabilities, plus the system's low cost (< 300 $) and open-source design, make DOPFLOW a promising research tool for developing new Doppler ultrasound technologies.

# Structure of the repository
This repository has the following folders:
- `control_board`, containing the source files to reproduce the control board.
- `hydraulic pump`, containing the source files to reproduce the hydraulic pump.
- `phantom`, containing the source files to reproduce the phantom structure, mimicking the common carotid artery and surrounding tissue.
- `software`, containing the source files for the graphical user interface (GUI) to control the motor.
- `docs`, containing the project documentation (e.g., images of the device, user manual, ...)

# Documentation 

The comprehensive [DOPFLOW User Manual](docs/dopflow_user_manual.pdf) located in the `docs/` folder, provides complete information on the DOPFLOW system, from assembly instructions to a detailed GUI overview. Itâ€™s designed to make the platform accessible and user-friendly for all, regardless of technical background.

# How to reproduce?

In a nutshell, to set up your own instance of DOPFLOW, follow these steps:

1. *Fabricate and assemble the hardware*<br>
   First, fabricate the phantom body and the hydraulic pump, then assemble and program the control board using instructions from the chapter 2 of the  [User Manual](docs/dopflow_user_manual.pdf) 

2. *Python dependencies installation on the host PC*<br>
   Follow the instructions in the `./software/` folder to install the dependencies.

# Usage

Please refer to chapter 3 of the [DOPFLOW User Manual](docs/dopflow_user_manual.pdf) for detailed information.

1. *Connect and power the control board*<br>
   Connect the PC to the control board, attach the hydraulic pump to the control board (connecting both the motor and limit switches), and power the control board using a 12 V, 2A lab power supply.

2. *Connect the phantom to the hydraulic pump*<br>
   Use a silicone hydraulic line to connect the phantom to the syringe pump.

3. *Run the graphical user interface (GUI)*<br>
   Launch the GUI, and use the controls to move the syringe and fill the phantom with the blood-mimicking fluid.

4. *Place the ultrasound transducer and perform measurements*<br>
   Position the ultrasound transducer on the phantom, run the custom pulse profile, and proceed with the measurements.
